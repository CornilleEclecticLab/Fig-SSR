This script performs the following steps:

1. Sets the working directory to where the Evanno output file is located.
2. Reads “EvannoTableOutput.txt” into a data frame.
3. Filters out rows where DeltaK is NA.
4. Creates a base R plot of DeltaK versus K (line + points).
5. Uses ggplot2 to build a modern version of the same plot.
6. Displays the ggplot2 object.
7. Saves the ggplot2 figure as a high-resolution JPEG named “delta_k_plot.jpeg”.
